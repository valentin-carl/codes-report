\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Challenges associated with Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, such as high
costs due to double billing, latency issues from cascading cold starts, and
inefficiencies in synchronous and asynchronous function calls, have been
addressed through novel approaches like \textsc{Fusionize}, SAND, and
\textsc{ProFaaStinate}. Our Project explored the integration of these approaches
within the open-source serverless platform Nuclio.

Our findings indicate that these approaches have the potential to enhance the
overall efficiency and resource utilization within serverless computing
platforms. However, Nuclio posed as an impractical choice of a FaaS platform due
to its instability, design decisions, and performance overheads. In general, the
potential of these approaches is limited by container orchestration systems that
are not designed for FaaS applications, like Kubernetes. We believe that these
solutions will yield better results if they are integrated on a platform
specifically engineered for them.
